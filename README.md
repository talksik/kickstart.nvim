## Introduction

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Single-file
* Completely Documented

I pulled it from tj, and made modifications.

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

## Installation

1. Install Neovim somehow. `brew install neovim` on mac.
2. Get some basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`), ripgrep
3. Install some font like nerd font.
4. `git clone [this_repo_url] ~/.config/nvim`
5. Go to the `.config/nvim` directory and run `nvim` to start installing things.
